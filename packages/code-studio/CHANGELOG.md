# [0.30.0](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/compare/v0.29.1...v0.30.0) (2023-02-13)

### Features

- Import JS API as a module ([#1084](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/1084)) ([9aab657](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/commit/9aab657ca674e404db6d3cf9b9c663627d635c2c)), closes [#444](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/444)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The JS API packaged as a module is now required for the
  `code-studio`, `embed-grid`, and `embed-chart` applications. Existing
  (Enterprise) applications should be able to use `jsapi-shim` still and
  load the JS API using the old method.
