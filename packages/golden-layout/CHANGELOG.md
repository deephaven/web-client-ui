# [0.63.0](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/compare/v0.62.0...v0.63.0) (2024-02-08)


### Features

* always show close button on the active panel in a stack ([#1773](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/1773)) ([33c6a8d](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/commit/33c6a8d39c17fb60d291ce4be9a77bbad16b4e65))

# [0.61.0](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/compare/v0.60.0...v0.61.0) (2024-02-01)


### Features

* allow themes to use any srgb color for definitions ([#1756](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/1756)) ([b047fa3](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/commit/b047fa36de3a285be925736ef73722a60d1d9ed7))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* - IrisGridThemeContext no longer accepts a paritial theme. By
guaranteeing the provider is a full theme we can resolve the CSS
variables and normailze the colors only once per theme load globally,
rather than having to do it once per grid.
- Themes must be defined using valid srgb CSS colors, and not hsl raw
component values
