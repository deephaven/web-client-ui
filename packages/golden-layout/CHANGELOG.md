### Features

- allow themes to use any srgb color for definitions ([#1756](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/1756)) ([b047fa3](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/commit/b047fa36de3a285be925736ef73722a60d1d9ed7))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- - IrisGridThemeContext no longer accepts a paritial theme. By
    guaranteeing the provider is a full theme we can resolve the CSS
    variables and normailze the colors only once per theme load globally,
    rather than having to do it once per grid.

* Themes must be defined using valid srgb CSS colors, and not hsl raw
  component values
