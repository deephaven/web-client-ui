### BREAKING CHANGES

- - Components `IrisGrid`, `Chart`, `ChartBuilder`,
    `AdvancedFilterCreator`, `GotoRow`, `IrisGridModelUpdater`,
    `TableCSVExporter` get the JSAPI reference from the `model` prop. `dh`
    prop removed.

* `makeApi` props in `IrisGridPanel` and `ChartPanel` removed.
* Components `Console`, `ConsoleMenu`, `ConsoleStatusBar` now require
  the JSAPI instance in the `dh` prop.
* `ConsoleUtils`: static methods `isTableType`, `isWidgetType`,
  `isOpenableType`, `isFigureType`, `isPandas` require JSAPI instance
  passed in the first argument.
* `SessionUtils`: static methods `createSessionWrapper`,
  `loadSessionWrapper` require JSAPI instance passed in the first
  argument.
* Class `IrisGridModel` requires JSAPI instance passed in the
  constructor args.
* Components `DashboardLayout`, `ObjectIcon` has to be wrapped in
  `ApiContext.Provider` passing the JSAPI instance.

- - Class `Formatter` requires the JSAPI instance as the first argument.

* Classes `DateTimeColumnFormatter`, `DecimalColumnFormatter`,
  `IntegerColumnFormatter`, `TableColumnFormatter`: static method
  `isValid` and constructor require the JSAPI instance in the first
  argument.
* Component `Chart` requires the JSAPI instance passed in the new prop
  `dh`.
* `WidgetUtils`: methods `createChartModel`, `createGridModel` methods
  require the JSAPI instance passed in the first argument.
* Components `DateTimeOptions`, `TableInput`, `useViewportData` have to
  be wrapped in `ApiContext.Provider` passing the JSAPI instance.
* `SettingsUtils`: methods `isValidFormat` and
  `isFormatRuleValidForSave` require the JSAPI instance passed in the
  first argument.
* `SessionUtils`: methods `createConnection`, `createCoreClient` require
  the JSAPI instance passed in the first argument.
* `TableUtils` static methods `applyCustomColumns`, `applyFilter`,
  `applyNeverFilter`, `applySort` converted to instance methods.
* Components `DropdownFilterPanel`, `Linker` now get the JSAPI instance
  from redux store.
* `DecimalFormatContextMenu.getOptions`,
  `IntegerFormatContextMenu.getOptions` now require the JSAPI instance in
  the first argument.

- - `ChartUtils` class now needs to be instantiated with a JSAPI object,
    most of the methods converted from static to instance methods.

* All `ChartModelFactory` methods require JSAPI object as the first
  argument.
* `FigureChartModel` constructor requires JSAPI object as the first
  argument.
