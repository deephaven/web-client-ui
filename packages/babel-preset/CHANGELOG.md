# [0.52.0](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/compare/v0.51.0...v0.52.0) (2023-10-27)


### Bug Fixes

* Theming - switched from ?inline to ?raw css imports ([#1600](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/1600)) ([f6d0874](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/commit/f6d0874a98cc7377c3857a44930b5c636b72ca1f)), closes [#1599](https://github.com/deephaven/web-client-ui/issues/1599)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Theme css imports were switched from `?inline` to
`?raw`. Not likely that we have any consumers yet, but this would impact
webpack config.
